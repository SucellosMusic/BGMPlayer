Godot v4.1

This was a project done eaerly in my time learning programming and Godot, and was spending time developing a workflow for writing and working with procedural/adaptive audio.
The idea was to create an application that could perpetually play background music without exact reptitions of each section of the music. 

Features include:
  1. start/stop
  2. quit
  3. global volume
  4. instrument mute toggles
